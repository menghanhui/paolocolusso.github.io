We now present the most represntative trolls of our story, the protagonists.

### FAVA LORENA

With her 2918 tweets, she can be considered as our most active character on social media. The subjects she deals with are innumerable. Some of them are related to contemporary problems (such as pollution), scandals (arms sales) and opposition to political actions. Furthermore, Lorena attacks both *left* and *right* parties, stressing social problems: this is coherent with the *Five-Star Movement* spirit. Indeed, from the geographical analysis we will present in the next section we can see that this character wrote tweets mentioning regions of Southern Italy, where the *Five-Star Movement* coalition won by a landslide.

# The tweets
Let’s take a closer look at some of the Lorena’s tweets.

### GUIDI VITTORE

With 1656 tweets, VITTOREGUIDI is another important character. His tweets are fewer than Lorena’s ones, but spread over a longer period. Again we can find social and political problems as main themes. He attacks both *left* party and *Five-Star Movement*, stressing issues related to migration: this is coherent with *League* ideas. Indeed, from the geographical analysis we will see that VITTOREGUIDI wrote tweets mention North and Central Italy regions, where the *League* (right) party obtained large fractions of the votes.

## GATTISILGATTI

GATTISILGATTI is definitely the most relevant character in terms of variety of topics. He does not seem to support a particular party, but his tweets tackle most of the contemporary issue. His tweets range from corruption to terrorism, from politics to social problems.
