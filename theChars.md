With her 2918 tweets, she can be considered as our most active character on social media. The subjects being highlighted are innumerable. Some of them are related to social problems (such as pollution), others are indignations against people'activities and finally we can find also disapproval at politicians.

### GUIDI VITTORE

With her 1656 tweets, he is another one important character in our story. His tweets are less than Lorena's tweets, but spread over a longer period. Again we can find social and political problems as main themes.

## GATTISILGATTI

He is definitely the most relevant character in terms of different topics. His tweets range from corruption to terrorism, from politics to social problems.
