The phenomenon of Russian IRA trolls has taken centre stage in the last months, casting a shadow on our understanding of the mechanisms which move social network discussions and debates in general.

### What is IRA?

IRA is a Russian agencies which has been acting in the last years as a producer of troll tweets, with the aim of interfering with online discussions. Fake profiles were cretaed which engage in and fosters political and social debate, creating a climate of divisiveness and hate.

### Why does it matter?

In a period of political instability due to the economic crisis and the challenges that Western States are facing, it is all the more important to try to understand what are the means by which IRA acts to exacerbates the weaknesses of our societyreinforces the tensions which characterise our countries.

### Still not convinced?

We will show you the proportions of this phenomenon, how the timing is carefully chosen, how the language stirs specific sentiments and much more: all of this with the specific focus of Italian tweets produced by trolls.

Nobody wants some external entity to impose a certain mindset, orient the political debate and pushing a particular point of view on delicate issues. Investigate the behaviour of Russian trolls means to foster informed and independent decisions, not spurred by heated online debates, and we will do so with the help of data.

The focus of this analysis is on the Italian tweets of IRA, which have not yet been a specific object of study. We want to see if and how the action of trolls adapts to the specific Italian situation: to do that, it might help to be familiar with some trends in the Italian socio-economic situation and political panorama. Some key facts are presented in the section [Before Starting](pages/beforeStarting).





### my history

> So why not use this data to sensibilize the citizens and help the administration to apply more detailed preventive measures?

The purpose of this project is to understand better the Geneva accidents in order to provide in the future, **real-time locally preventive measures** in form of digital panels advice, sporadic police controls or provide input information to the future self-driving cars.


In a more digitalized world, there will be more and more cities providing complete and rich information about the road traffic data. Furthermore, the work done by the authors could be scaled up in other cities.  


## Structure:

This website is structured in four sections:
1. [Getting started](pages/Gilcompa) where a general overview is provided.
2. [A visual story](/pages/Milani) is developped to analyse some particular accident cases.
3. [The risk calculator](/pages/risk_calculator), a quick tool to compute the risk associated to roads in Geneva
4. [Safety maps](/pages/safety_map) proof of concept of how we could apply the computed risk per road to directions applications (e.g. SBB/CFF or Google Maps)
