Italy is nowadays seen as one of the weakest economies of the Eurozone, with high levels of unemployment and growth rates which fail to keep up with those of other countries. Its politics is particularly unstable and the electoral system fails to give rise to lasting governments and stable majorities, so that elections are frequent and the number of prime ministers in the last two decades is unrivalled, 14 in the last 24 years.

### What's happening in politics?

The political equilibrium has shifted towards less traditional parties following the economic crisis and the fall of Silvio Berlusconi, who has been the most stable political figure since 1994. The main parties at the moment are:

1. The **Democratic Party** (PD), a centre-left party which lacks a strrong leadership after Matteo Renzi lost popularity following a defeat in the 2006 constitutional referendum. Matteo Renzi has been secretary of the party from 2014 to 2016 and Prime Minister during the same years. ![](../img/renzi){: .align-center}

2. The **League**. Formerly known as the Northern League, a party supporting the independence of Northern Italy, the right-wing League set itself more national ambitions. It is a populist party, and currently the main party in the country, as well as the member of the coalition government together with M5S. Its key points are migration and the challenge of European rigidities in terms of budget limitations.

3. The **Five-Star Movement** (M5S) is a populist party, which aims at tackling social inequalities and fighting political privileges.

Both the League and the M5S hold eurosceptic positions, blaming the crisis on the common currency, the big financial institutions and the little flexibility available within the agreements of the European Union.

As many political commentators have stressed, a government formed by the M5S and the League is a threat to the stability of the Eurozone, and this is the reason why Russia, whose political ambitions are in conflict with those of the EU, might have all the interests to support it.
