subtitle: Italian trolls: a top view.

We take a closer look at the proportions of the phenomenon with respect to the Italian part of the IRA tweets.

### Followers and Following
Although figures on this side has to be taken with caution, since we cannot rule out altogether the possibility of there being bots and scams, the data show that proportions are quite impressive in terms of number of following,

and followers:

The following histogram (in log scale, as the previous ones) sums up the daily activity of trolls, in terms of the average number of tweets produced every day:

It looks like trolls try to cover all the spectrum of sizes and activity levels: always under the aforementioned *caveat*, some of them are extremely prolific, some others have a low key profile. We will see this tendency in virtually all of the topics we consider: the idea is probably the fact that trolls try to engage as wide a public as possible.

### Time Analysis

### Content analysis
We now delve into the content of tweet themselves, starting by a general overview. Which words are occurring the most?

Italian readers will notice that most of the words are names of **newspapers** and news agencies, with a peculiarity: it is hard to spot the the presence of radical papers. *la Repubblica* is the best selling Italian paper, followed by *Corriere della Sera* and *La Stampa*, while *ANSA* is the main press agency. Although *la Repubblica* is rather centre-left wing, all of these are generally perceived to be as moderate and reliable by the majority of the population: this is probably also the impression trolls want to give.

If we now exclude papers and press agencies from the cloud, a clearer picture emerges: politics is clearly on top when it comes to favourite topics for trolls.

If we look at **national politics**, all the themes which have determined the results of the most recent elections are there: *migrants*, *Europe*, *security*. The name of the main parties is also present, together with some leaders' name. Although *Renzi* and *Democartic Party*, *PD*, are of larger size than their political opponents, other parties are more represented in terms of political priorities: *migrants* and *security* are the main target of the *League*, for example. Taking a further look at the output of the word cloud, one will notice that words associated to the *PD* crisis feature highly (corruption scandals, internal fight for the leadership of the party...).

Shifting to **international politics**, Trump is the big name. More generally, the words mainly refer to the weaknesses of the European Union: **terror attacks**, **Brexit**, the **common currency**... The lexicon seem to be dominated by negative words, which conveys the idea of the current situation in Europe being doomed. But there is more to it. Except for Germany and France, the countries mentioned have one common feature: they are ruled by authoritarian leaders: **Turkey** (Erdogan), **Syria** (Assad), **Russia** (Putin). Of course, a similar idea holds for **Trump**, which is typically perceived as strong and tough, especially in terms of migration. Also, notice that Syria is the one of the main interests of the Russian foreign politics.

Laslty, words as **fear**, **terror**, **risk**, **terrorism**, **massacre**, **attack** clearly want to stress a situation of instability.

It is hardly surprising that Russia would try to provide a negative picture of our institutions: lack of faith in traditional parties and institutions has already lead towards increased success of populist parties all across Europe, making it weaker. All of this creates sympathy towards more authoritative figures, like Putin and Trump, who present themselves as strong in defending their country's interests.
