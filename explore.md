subtitle: Italian trolls: a top view.

We take a closer look at the proportions of the phenomenon with respect to the Italian part of the IRA tweets.

### Followers and Following
Although figures on this side has to be taken with caution, since we cannot rule out altogether the possibility of there being bots and scams, the data show that proportions are quite impressive in terms of number of following,

and followers:

The following histogram (in log scale, as the previous ones) sums up the daily activity of trolls, in terms of the average number of tweets produced every day:

It looks like trolls try to cover all the spectrum of sizes and activity levels: always under the aforementioned *caveat*, some of them are extremely prolific, some others have a low key profile. We will see this tendency in virtually all of the topics we consider: the idea is probably the fact that trolls try to engage as wide a public as possible.

### Time Analysis

Is there a peak of activity of trolls during significant moments of the past years? If trolls intend to influence our perception of politics and society, we would expect them to give relevance to disruptive events, crisis and elections and to be more active on these occasions.

To get a visual intuition of this fact we plot the historical evolution of the number of tweets per day.

We observe a period of exceptional activity in the first months of 2017. These corresponded to months of political tension across Europe due to the presence of numerous terrorists' attacks: London, Stockholm, Paris, St Petersburg, Manchester were among the cities which witnessed these attacks. Of course Russian trolls would use the rise of Islamic terrorism as a sign of the difficulties of Europe and as a way to support the anti-immigration messages of populist parties.

We now zoom in on the other months and look for further evidence of the divisive strategy of trolls.

We highlighted:

1. migratory crisis;

2. the Italian constitutional referendum, whose outcome was one of the main causes of the fall of the centre-left party;

3. the build-up to the general elections.

If, as we claim, Russian trolls aim at spurring political instability in Europe, it is natural that they should focus on disruptive events showing the weaknesses of our society. Also, they would be likely to touch upon themes that are key in the political agenda of populist parties (*Leaugue* and *Five-Star Movement*), making Europe more frail and threatening the stability of international relationships. They would naturally encourage political debate, creating divisiveness in the country.

What we see is indeed that they are more active during periods coinciding with peaks of terrorism in Europe, migratory crisis and political events.


### Content analysis
We now delve into the content of tweet themselves, starting by a general overview. Which words are occurring the most? 

![](../img/word1.png){: .align-center}

Italian readers will notice that most of the words are names of **newspapers** and news agencies, with a peculiarity: it is hard to spot the the presence of radical papers. *la Repubblica* is the best selling Italian paper, followed by *Corriere della Sera* and *La Stampa*, while *ANSA* is the main press agency. Although *la Repubblica* is rather centre-left wing, all of these are generally perceived to be as moderate and reliable by the majority of the population: this is probably also the impression trolls want to give.

If we now exclude papers and press agencies from the cloud, a clearer picture emerges: politics is clearly on top when it comes to favourite topics for trolls.

If we look at **national politics**, all the themes which have determined the results of the most recent elections are there: *migrants*, *Europe*, *security*. The name of the main parties is also present, together with some leaders' name. Although *Renzi* and *Democartic Party*, *PD*, are of larger size than their political opponents, other parties are more represented in terms of political priorities: *migrants* and *security* are the main target of the *League*, for example. Taking a further look at the output of the word cloud, one will notice that words associated to the *PD* crisis feature highly (corruption scandals, internal fight for the leadership of the party...).

Shifting to **international politics**, Trump is the big name. More generally, the words mainly refer to the weaknesses of the European Union: **terror attacks**, **Brexit**, the **common currency**... The lexicon seem to be dominated by negative words, which conveys the idea of the current situation in Europe being doomed. But there is more to it. Except for Germany and France, the countries mentioned have one common feature: they are ruled by authoritarian leaders: **Turkey** (Erdogan), **Syria** (Assad), **Russia** (Putin). Of course, a similar idea holds for **Trump**, which is typically perceived as strong and tough, especially in terms of migration. Also, notice that Syria is the one of the main interests of the Russian foreign politics.

Laslty, words as **fear**, **terror**, **risk**, **terrorism**, **massacre**, **attack** clearly want to stress a situation of instability.

It is hardly surprising that Russia would try to provide a negative picture of our institutions: lack of faith in traditional parties and institutions has already lead towards increased success of populist parties all across Europe, making it weaker. All of this creates sympathy towards more authoritative figures, like Putin and Trump, who present themselves as strong in defending their country's interests.
